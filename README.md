## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system follows a microservice architecture:

```
                       +-------------------+
                       |   Angular Frontend |
                       +-------------------+
                                |
                                v
                     +---------------------+
                     |    API Gateway       |
                     +---------------------+
                                |
        -------------------------------------------------
        |                     |                      |
        v                     v                      v
+----------------+   +------------------+   +------------------+
|  Employee Svc  |   |  Activity Svc     |   |  Urgency Svc     |
+----------------+   +------------------+   +------------------+

```

Each service is independently deployable and communicates via HTTP/REST APIs.
