# üèîÔ∏è Mountain Service Project

A modular, microservice-based system designed for managing mountain operations‚Äîcoordinating employee shifts, tracking activities, and responding to urgencies in real time. Built with Go and Angular, this project emphasizes scalability, clarity, and role-based workflows.

## Features

- Employee shift scheduling with role constraints (Medic, Technical, Administrator)
- Activity tracking for mountain operations
- Urgency management with real-time escalation
- Role-based access and user authentication
- Angular-based frontend with localization support
- Kubernetes deployment (k8s/) with Secrets via GitHub Actions

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for:
- TypeScript model generation/validation
- Backend/frontend test coverage
- Kubernetes deployment with kubectl (see .github/workflows/k8s-deploy.yml)

See docs/CI-CD-MODEL-GENERATION.md for model generation details.

## Architecture

The system follows a microservice architecture:

```
                       +-------------------+
                       |   Angular Frontend |
                       +-------------------+
                                |
                                v
                     +---------------------+
                     |    API Gateway       |
                     +---------------------+
                                |
        -------------------------------------------------
        |                     |                      |
        v                     v                      v
+----------------+   +------------------+   +------------------+
|  Employee Svc  |   |  Activity Svc     |   |  Urgency Svc     |
+----------------+   +------------------+   +------------------+

```

Each service is independently deployable and communicates via HTTP/REST APIs.

## Microservices

| Service           | Description                                | Path                        |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Employee Service  | Manages employee profiles and shifts       | `api/employee/`             |
| Activity Service  | Tracks mountain-related tasks and logs     | `api/activity/`             |
| Urgency Service   | Handles alerts and critical notifications  | `api/urgency/`              |
| API Gateway       | Entry point that routes requests           | `api/api-gateway/`          |
| Frontend (Angular)| UI for employees/admins                    | `frontend/`                 |

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/mountain-service.git
cd mountain-service
```

2. Kubernetes quick start:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/namespaces.yaml
kubectl -n mountain apply -f k8s/deployments/
kubectl -n mountain apply -f k8s/services/
kubectl -n mountain apply -f k8s/frontend/
```

3. GitHub Secrets required: see docs/README.k8s-variables.md

4. For legacy Docker instructions, see deprecated/README.md

- [Backend README](./api/README.md)
- [Frontend README](./ui/README.md)

---

## CI/CD and Deployment

- Test coverage workflows are kept: backend-test-coverage.yml, frontend-test-coverage.yml
- Deployment to Kubernetes is handled by .github/workflows/k8s-deploy.yml
- Legacy AWS/docker-compose workflows and scripts are in deprecated/

Secrets required for K8s: see docs/README.k8s-variables.md

3. For more specific setup instructions, refer to individual README files:
