# Deprecated Artifacts

This folder contains legacy deployment files preserved for reference during the migration to Kubernetes.

Moved here:
- docker-compose.aws.yml
- docker-compose.frontend.yml
- DEPLOYMENT.md (legacy content)
- Shell deployment scripts (deploy-backend.sh, deploy-frontend.sh)
- GitHub Actions workflows for AWS/docker-compose

Use the Kubernetes deployment under k8s/ and the new docs in docs/K8S_GITHUB_SECRETS.md and k8s/README.md.
